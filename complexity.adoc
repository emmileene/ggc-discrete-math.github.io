= Computational Complexity


== Algorithmic complexity
Computer programmers  are often concerned with two questions:

a) How much time does an algorithm need to complete?

b) How much memory does an algorithm need for its computation?

__Big $O$__  notation is an standard way, mathematicians and computer scientists use to describe how much time and how much memory is required for an algorithm to run

__Big $O$__  is typically used to analyze the worst case complexity of an algorithm. If, for example, $n$, is the size of the input data, then __Big $O$__ really only cares about what happens when your input data size, $n$, becomes arbitrarily large and not quite as interested in when the input is small.  Mathematically, we want to speak of complexity in the asymptotic sense, that $n$ is arbitrarily large. In this asymptotic sense of large $n$, we may ignore constants.

The size of the input complexities ordered from smallest to largest:

* Constant Complexity: $O(1)$
* Logarithmic Complexity: $O(log (n))$,
* Linear Complexity: $O(n)$
* Linearithmic Complexity: $O(nlog (n))$,
* Radical complexity : $O(\sqrt{n})$
* Quadratic complexity: $O(n^2)$
* Cubic complexity: $O(n^3)$,
* Exponential complexity: $O(b^n)$, $ b > 1$
* Factorial complexity: $ O(n!)$

Radical growth is larger than logarithmic growth:

Using the graphical analysis of the growth of typical functions we observe that we have the following growth ordering,

[asciimath]
++++
1,log \ ⁡n, root(3)(n),  sqrt x , n, n^2, n^3,2^n,3^n,n!, n^n
++++

The asymptotic behavior for large $n$, should be determined by the most dominant term, in the function for large $n$. For example, $f(x)=x^{3} + 2x^{2}-2x$ , for large $x$, is dominated by the term $x^3$. In this case we want to state that $O(f(x))=x^3$. For example $f(1000) =1.001998×10^9≈ 1×10^9 =1000^3$. For large $x$, $f(x) ≈x^3$,  or asymptotically $f(x)$ behaves as $x^3$, for large $x$. We say $O(f(x))=x^3$ , for $f(x)=x^3 +2x^2-2x$.

Likewise we want to say that if $c$ is a constant that $c \cdot f(x)$, and $f(x)$ have the same asymptotic behavior for large $n$, or $O(c \cdot f(x))=O(f(x))$.

Motivated by these we define the _Big $O$_ notation,

Definition of _Big $O$_ notation::
Suppose $f$ and $g$ are real valued functions from $f(x):\mathbb{R}→\mathbb{R}$,
we say $f(x)$ is __Big $O$__ of $g(x$), written $f(x)$, is,  $O(g(x))$, if there exists
positive integers, $A$, and $n$, so that $|f(x)|  ≤ A|g(x)|$ whenever $x  > n$.

To determine if a function $f(x)$ is $O(g(x))$, amounts to
identifying the, positive constants $A$, and $n$, (sometimes called witnesses).
That is, we must find the factor $ A$  and the point, $ k $, for which $ f(x)  ≤ A g(x)$, whenever $ x > k.$

Example:

Consider $f\left(x\right)=2x^2 +4x$, while intuitively we may understand that
the dominant term for large $x$, is $x^2$ so that $f(x) = O\left(x^2\right)$,
we show this formally by producing as witnesses, $A=3$ and $n =4$ with
reference to the following graph,

Example:

Show that $f(x) =2x^3 +3x$, is $O(x^3)$, with $A=3$ and $n=2$. Support
your answer graphically.
Solution:

Notice that $ x^3 > 3x$, when $ x  ≥ 2$. This means $2x^3 +x^3 >  2x^3 +3x $, when $x >2 $.
In other words $ 3x^3 > 2x^3 +3x$, whenever $ x>2$, confirming $A=3$, and $n=2$, as witnesses, and supported by the
following graph.

To show that a function $ f(x)$, is not $O(g(x))$, means that no $A$ can scale
$g(x)$, so that $ Ag(x)  ≥  f(x)$ for $x$ large enough.

Example:
Show that $ f(x) = x^2$, is not $  O( \sqrt{x})$

Solution
Consider the graphs of $ \sqrt{x}$, $ 2 \sqrt{x}$, $ 3\sqrt{x}$, and the graph of $x^2$.
Notice that eventually, or for $x$ large enough, $x^2$ is larger than any $A \sqrt{x}$
as in the figure below

Suppose $A>1$, is  given, and fixed,  then if $ f(x) = x^2$ is $ O(g(x))=O( \sqrt{x})$ ,  there is some $n$ for which $A  \sqrt{x}  ≥ x^2$ whenever $x>n$.
Well $ g(x) =A \sqrt{x} = x^2=f(x) $, when $ x =A^{2/3}$, but then $A  \sqrt{x} < x^2$ when $ x > A^{2/3}$, hence no such $n$, can exist for a given fixed $A$.
For example consider $g(x)=A  \sqrt{x}$ and $ f(x) =x^2 $,
when $ x= A^2$, we obtain, $ g(A^2) = A  \sqrt{(A^2)}= A^2$, and $ f(A^2) = {\left ( {A}^2 \right )}^2$, and
$ f(A^2)= A^4 > A^2 = g(A^2)  $, when $A>1$.



Properties of _Big $O$_ notation.
Suppose $f(x)$ is $O(F(x))$ and, $g(x)$ is $O(G(x))$

. $c \cdot f(x)$ is $O(F(x))$,
. $ f (x )+g(x)$ is $O(max \left ( F(x), G(x) \right )$
. $ f (x ) \cdot g(x))$ is $O(F(x) \cdot G(x))$

We can use these properties to show for instance $ 2x^2$ is  $O\left(x^2\right)$. Likewise
if $f(x) =2x^2$, and $g(x) =4x$, then $ 2x^2$ is $O(x^2)$, and $ 4x$ is $O(x)$,
and the maximum gives that $2x^2+4x$ is $ O(max(x^2, x)) =O(x^2)$.

It is true in general that if a polynomial $f(x)$ has degree $n$ then $f(x)$ is $O(x^n)$.

Fact:

$p(x)=a_nx^n +a_{n-1}x^{n-1} +a_{n-2}x^{n-2}+\ldots +a_2x^2 +a_1x^1+a_0$, is $O(x^n)$

For example, if $f(x)= x^3+1$, being, $ O(x^3)$ and $g(x)=x^2-x$, being $O(x^2)$ then
$f(x) \cdot g(x)$ is $O(x^3 \cdot x^2) =O(x^5)$, which is verified explicitly by multiplying
$f(x) \cdot g(x)= (x^3+1) \cdot (x^2-x)= x^5 -x^4+x^2-x  $, which clearly is $O(x^5)$

Example
In the graph below, using a logarithmic scale, we summarize the growth ordering of important functions, including logarithmic, polynomial,
exponential, and factorial.

Example:
Order the following functions by growth.
$n⋅log_2⁡ n$  , $n^2$, $n^{4/3}$.
Solution:
Recall the ordering,

Notice that

$n⋅log_{2⁡}n=n×log_{2⁡}n$

$n^2=n×n$

$n^{4/3} =n×n^{1/3}$

Using the following ordering, $log n$, $n^{1/3}$, $n$, we obtain
also the following ordering,
$n⋅logn$, $n^{4/3}$,  $n^2$.
